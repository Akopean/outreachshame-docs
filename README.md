# Outreach shame

What is outreach shame?

## How can you contribute?

It's simple, just forward us the email to **outreachshame@snipcart.com** and we'll publish it on the blog as soon as our team approves it! We kindly ask you to censor any personal information from the email before forwarding it to us. Any emails with sensitive information won't make it to the blog.

## How it works?

When we approve a submission, a commit is pushed in this [Github Repostiory](https://github.com/snipcart/outreachshame). We then use [Forestry](https://forestry.io/#/) to make content editing and publishing easier for our marketing folks. Once the entry is published, the site is built and delpoyed automatically on Netlify.
