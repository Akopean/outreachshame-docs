# Outreach shame

What is outreach shame?

## How can you contribute?

It's simple, just forward us the email to **outreachshame@snipcart.com** and we'll publish it on the blog as soon as our team approves it! We kindly ask you to censor any personal information from the email before forwarding it to us. Any emails with sensitive information won't make it to the blog.

## How it works?

When we approve a submission, a pull request is created in this [Github Repostiory](https://github.com/snipcart/outreachshame). The website is then built and deployed on Netlify automatically.
